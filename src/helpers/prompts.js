Chat Analysis Instructions

Act as a professional information parser. Analyze the provided telegram chat logs and extract two key elements: factual events/statements and expressed opinions. Follow the guidelines below precisely.

1. EVENTS AND HEADLINES (Facts)
- Extract all verifiable events and factual statements from the logs.
- Include only confirmed facts; exclude opinions, speculations, or unverified claims.
- Keep entries concise, accurate, and free of embellishment.

2. OPINIONS
- Identify opinions explicitly expressed in the chat logs related to specific events/headlines.
- Link each opinion to its corresponding fact (e.g., "Relates to Fact 1: [Opinion]").
- Do not invent opinions if none are present.
- Avoid grouping multiple events under a single opinion; maintain specificity.

Format Guidelines
- Present results as two distinct numbered lists: "Facts" and "Opinions."
- Example:

  Facts
  1. The sky is blue.
  2. Water is wet.

  Opinions
  1. Relates to Fact 1: The sky is blue because people are happy.
  2. Relates to Fact 2: Water is wet because it’s from India.

- Use simple, consistent formatting; do not deviate or add extra structure.
- Exclude trivial or surface-level statements (e.g., "Denys has a website") unless they provide meaningful insight.

Critical Instructions
1. Treat this task with utmost precision, as if lives depend on it; do not skip or omit data unless explicitly instructed.
2. When analyzing multiple pre-analyzed feed responses, preserve all prior information and structure without loss.
3. Exclude data only for reasons specified in this prompt (e.g., Reddit negativity, trivial statements).

Notes
- Do not hallucinate or infer beyond the provided content.
- Maintain neutrality and accuracy in all extractions.

Feed Analysis Instructions

Act as a professional information parser. Analyze the provided feed sections and extract two key elements: factual events/statements and expressed opinions. Follow the guidelines below precisely.

1. EVENTS AND HEADLINES (Facts)
- Extract all verifiable events and factual statements from the feed.
- Include only confirmed facts; exclude opinions, speculations, or unverified claims.
- Keep entries concise, accurate, and free of embellishment.
- For content resembling study abstracts, include the study name in parentheses (e.g., "X occurred (Study Name)").
- Special Handling for YouTube Feeds:
    - If the feed section appears to be primarily YouTube channel info (e.g., creator bio, multiple platform links like Patreon/PayPal, or secondary channels), ignore all extraneous details and output only: "Creator [Name] has a new video about [Topic]" (use the video description or title to determine the topic if available; if not, use "unspecified topic").
    - For YouTube links with timestamps or specific descriptions, summarize the video’s topic and relevance (e.g., "Video by [Name] discusses [Topic] at [Timestamp], relevant for [Reason]").
- For Reddit-like sections, include only explanations of recovery methods (e.g., "User did X to improve Y"); exclude complaints, symptoms, or negativity.

2. OPINIONS
- Identify opinions explicitly expressed in the feed related to specific events/headlines.
- Link each opinion to its corresponding fact (e.g., "Relates to Fact 1: [Opinion]").
- Do not invent opinions if none are present.
- Avoid grouping multiple events under a single opinion; maintain specificity.

Format Guidelines
- Present results as two distinct numbered lists: "Facts" and "Opinions."
- Example:

  Facts
  1. The sky is blue.
  2. Water is wet.

  Opinions
  1. Relates to Fact 1: The sky is blue because people are happy.
  2. Relates to Fact 2: Water is wet because it’s from India.

- Use simple, consistent formatting; do not deviate or add extra structure.
- Exclude trivial or surface-level statements (e.g., "Denys has a website") unless they provide meaningful insight.

Critical Instructions
1. Treat this task with utmost precision, as if lives depend on it; do not skip or omit data unless explicitly instructed.
2. For YouTube feeds with minimal context (e.g., channel info and a link), state only: "Creator X has a new video about Y" (if the topic is clear from the description).
3. When analyzing multiple pre-analyzed feed responses, preserve all prior information and structure without loss.
4. Exclude data only for reasons specified in this prompt (e.g., Reddit negativity, trivial statements).

Notes
- Do not hallucinate or infer beyond the provided content.
- Maintain neutrality and accuracy in all extractions.

# Feed Aggregation Instructions

Act as a professional data aggregator. Take multiple outputs from the "Feed Analysis Instructions" prompt (each containing "Facts" and "Opinions" lists separated by "SEPARATOR") and combine them into a single output. Follow these guidelines:

Aggregation Rules
- Combine all "Facts" from each input into one "Facts" list.
- Combine all "Opinions" from each input into one "Opinions" list.
- Do not lose or omit any items from the original lists; include every fact and opinion exactly as provided.
- Remove duplicates if the exact same fact or opinion appears multiple times across inputs (e.g., "The sky is blue" listed thrice becomes one entry).
- Preserve the original wording and structure of each item (e.g., study names in parentheses, "Relates to Fact X" in opinions).

Sorting by Importance
- Sort the "Facts" list by general importance in the world, with the most significant events/statements first. Use these criteria:
  - Global impact (e.g., events affecting millions rank higher than local incidents).
  - Scientific or historical significance (e.g., a breakthrough study ranks above a trivial observation).
  - Timeliness and relevance (e.g., recent major events rank higher than outdated ones).
  - If importance is unclear or equal, maintain the original order from the first appearance.
- Sort the "Opinions" list to align with the sorted "Facts" list:
  - Group opinions under their corresponding fact (e.g., all opinions tied to "Fact 1" stay together).
  - If an opinion relates to a fact no longer present (e.g., due to deduplication), note it as "Relates to removed duplicate: [Opinion]."
  - Within each fact’s opinions, list them in the order they first appeared across inputs.

Format Guidelines
- Output two numbered lists: "Facts" and "Opinions," following this example:
  
  Facts
  1. Water is wet.
  2. The sky is blue.

  Opinions
  1. Relates to Fact 1: Water is wet because it’s from India.
  2. Relates to Fact 2: The sky is blue because people are happy.
  
- Use simple, consistent numbering; do not add extra formatting or sections.
- Ensure the output is concise and accurate, with no embellishment.

Critical Instructions
- Treat this task with precision, as if lives depend on it; every fact and opinion must be accounted for unless explicitly removed as a duplicate.
- If an input lacks a "Facts" or "Opinions" section, note it in the output (e.g., "No opinions provided for this input").
- Do not infer importance beyond the provided content and sorting criteria; rely on objective judgment.

Notes
- Inputs will be separated by "SEPARATOR" in the provided text.
- Do not hallucinate or modify content beyond aggregation and sorting.

2. The sky is blue.  [Lower: observable but less impactful]

---

Opinions
1. Relates to Fact 1: Water is wet because it’s from India.
2. Relates to Fact 1: Water is wet because it’s from India.  [Duplicate removed, only one kept]
3. Relates to Fact 2: The sky is blue because people are happy.


Explanation
- Deduplication: Identical facts ("The sky is blue") and opinions were consolidated.
- Sorting: "Water is wet" ranked higher due to its universal importance (life-sustaining) vs. "The sky is blue" (aesthetic/atmospheric observation).
- Opinion Alignment: Opinions stay tied to their facts and are listed in order of first appearance after sorting.
